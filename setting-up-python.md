# Setting up Python the right way ü§û

Setting up Python on your computer is hard because there are many ways to do it.

Off the top of my head, the popular ones are:

1. Use the Python that comes pre-installed with macOS‚Äîbad idea because you don't want to pollute this
1. Download and install directly from python.org‚Äîbad idea because it messes up your path
1. Install it using a package manager, like brew‚Äîok'ish idea, but you have no control of versions
1. **Install using a Python installation manager, like pyenv‚Äîbetter idea, (but linux and macOS only)** üëà we'll use this

# But first, what is your `PATH`, and how does it work?

When you open your terminal and run `python` like so:

...your computer needs to know where to find `python`. You may have many `python`s installed on your computer, so how do you know _which_ one your OS is running? Simple, use `which`:

```bash
$ which python
/usr/bin/python
```

My OS is telling me that when I run `python`, it's using the `python` interpreter located in `/usr/bin/`.

Your terminal has access to a variable called `PATH` which is a _list_ of folders (seperated by `:`s) that are searched for any program you invoke. Here's what my PATH looks like:

```bash
$ echo $PATH
/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin
```

So when I run `python` in my terminal, the following folders will be searched for a `python` executable:

1. `/usr/bin`
1. `/usr/local/bin`
1. `/bin`
1. `/usr/sbin`
1. `/sbin`

and the first result will be the one executed.

This has implications for installing Python as it may be installed in a less prioritized folder and so will never be run. So it's crucial to understand how to modify your `PATH` if you run into trouble. 

Your shell (the program your terminal runs when it starts) usually runs a script when you open it. Using a fresh installation of macOS? Then you're likely using `bash`, which runs the file `/Users/dvf/.bash_profile` when it starts. You can place any code in here if you want it to run when your terminal loads, including any `PATH` modifications:

For example, if you want to prepend `/some/new/path/to/python` at the beginning of your `PATH`, you can do:
```bash
export PATH="/some/new/path/to/python:$PATH"
```

As you'll see later, tools like Virtual Environments or `pyenv` are actually just modifying your `PATH` to point to different versions of Python.d

# Installing `pyenv`

[pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) is an installation and version manager for Python, similar to Ruby's `rvm`.  It can download new versions of Python and change the version of Python referenced in your `PATH`. 

Follow the instructions on the [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) as close as you can‚Äîthere are some subtle steps!

Here's how it works:

``` bash
# Install Python 3.7.4
$ pyenv install 3.7.4

# But it won't change your Python interpreter until you tell it to
$ python --version
Python 2.7.10

# Let's make a new folder for a project and set it to use a particular version of Python
$ mkdir my_project && cd my_project
$ pyenv local 3.7.4

# pyenv now knows to use Python 3.7.4 when in the my_project folder
$ python --version
Python 3.7.4

# If you want to change to Python 3.7.4 everywhere, then do
$ pyenv global 3.7.4
$ python --version
Python 3.7.4
```

You'll notice that `pyenv` modifies your `PATH`. Here's what my PATH looks like after installing `pyenv`:

```bash
$ echo $PATH
/Users/dvf/.pyenv/shims:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin
```

Once you've installed `pyenv` and a suitable version of Python you're good to go. üèÅ
